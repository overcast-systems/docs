# FAQ

<h1>
  The script does not load on my server<br />
  I get the following error message:<br />
  <span style={{ fontSize: '70%', color: 'red' }}>
    ```You lack the required entitlement to use <ocs_vitalcore>```
  </span>
</h1>

This usually occurs when you started the server with a different account than the one you bought the script with. <br />

# FAQ

<h1>
  The script does not load on my server<br />
  I get the following error message:<br />
  <span style={{ fontSize: '70%', color: 'red' }}>
    ```You lack the required entitlement to use <ocs_vitalcore>```
  </span>
</h1>

This error is <u>not</u> caused by us or our script. This usually comes from starting your FiveM server with an account that is different from the one you bought the script with.  <br />
Please follow **[these steps](https://support.cfx.re/hc/en-us/articles/8016140406428-Asset-escrow-common-errors)** to resolve this issue.

# Installation

## Downloading The Script
After you have bought the script on our tebex store page you automatically received it in your [keymaster account](/) and in the [Cfx.re Portal](https://portal.cfx.re/login). 
We recommend using the Cfx.&#8203;re Portal due to keymaster being shutdown soon but the two websites are basically the same.
On the [Assets](https://portal.cfx.re/assets/granted-assets?page=1&sort=asset.updated_at&direction=asc) page you will find all your bought assets, including ours. Simply click on **download** and you should have the files on your computer.

## Installing The Script
After the download you should have received a .zip folder.
Use a tool like 7zip, WinRAR or the default Windows extractor to unzip the folder.
###  Windows Extractor
```Right Click on the folder -> Extract all... -> Check "Show extracted files when complete" -> Hit "Extract"```
A new window will open with the installation files and additional information.

### 7zip
```Right Click on the folder -> 7zip -> Open archive / Extract Here / Extract files... (-> Choose a location to extract the files)```
A new 7zip window will open with the installation files and additional information.

### WinRAR
```RIght Click on the folder -> Extract Here / Extract files... (-> Choose a location to extract the files)```

## Installing It In Your Resources Folder
1. Once the files have been extracted locate your FiveM Server's resource folder and open it.
2. Choose a folder to install the script in or if you don't want to you can just install it in the root folder.
3. Drag and drop <u>only</u> the `ocs_vitalcore` folder from the extracted files into your resource folder or a subfolder of such.
4. Finished, you have successfully installed the script.

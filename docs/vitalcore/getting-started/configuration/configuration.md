import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

This script has a lot of options to configure and we understand that some options might be confusing at first. We will guide you through each option individually.

Click **[here](/docs/vitalcore/how-it-works/how-it-works.md)** to learn more about the mechanics behind the script and to get a better understanding of how every option affects the player.

## Important Notes Before Configuring

1. <u>Never</u> change the name of the script as this will result in a broken code
2. Don't touch any lines of code if you don't know what you're doing, as some parts of the main script code are openly accessible. We don't provide any support for the code you added yourself or changed in the script

## Configurable Files
